        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Micah and I grew up in a small agricultural town called Mims, Florida.  After graduating high school I joined the Air Force as an avionics technician.  Between training stints and deployments I got to call many places home.  After the military I continued my career at Bombardier Aerospace, and took on Army contracts for a small aircraft modification company.  Within the past few years I moved to Seattle to transition careers into the IT sector, and recently I was hired at Amazon to participate in their software developer engineer apprentice program.</p>
